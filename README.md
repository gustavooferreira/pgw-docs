# API Specifications

The documentation of the APIs was created using OpenAPI (fka Swagger).

The specs are stored inside the `openapi` folder.

To view the specs, either use [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and import the yaml files (one at a time), or just click the links below, which will redirect you directly to Swagger UI:

- [Merchant API Spec](https://petstore.swagger.io/)
- [Management API Spec](https://petstore.swagger.io/)
